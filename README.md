# P07_React_ContextAPI_LocalStorage
I created a web-based todo list using React and the Context API, with tasks stored in local storage as JSON. The app features full CRUD operations: adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. This project showcases efficient state management and data persistence in a practical application.
