# P07_React_ContextAPI_LocalStorage
I recently completed a web-based todo list application using React, which was an exciting opportunity to apply and expand my skills with the Context API. This project allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with several key features:

Context API Integration: Seamless state management across components, eliminating the need for prop drilling.
Local Storage: Tasks are stored in local storage in JSON format, ensuring data persistence even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
CRUD Operations: The application supports full CRUD functionality:
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
Check Completion: Mark tasks as completed, allowing you to keep track of your progress.
This project was a comprehensive exercise in building a practical application while leveraging the power of React's Context API and local storage. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm excited to share it with the community!
